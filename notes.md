## Django App concept

An app in Django is a Python package that encapsulates related models, views, templates, and other supporting files necessary to implement a specific web application feature or functionality. Each app is designed to be modular, allowing developers to create, manage, and reuse discrete components of functionality across different projects.

```python
python3 manage.py startapp <name_for_the_package>
```
