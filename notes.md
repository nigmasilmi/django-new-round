## Django App concept

An app in Django is a Python package that encapsulates related models, views, templates, and other supporting files necessary to implement a specific web application feature or functionality. Each app is designed to be modular, allowing developers to create, manage, and reuse discrete components of functionality across different projects.

```python
python3 manage.py startapp <name_for_the_package>
```

## Urls and Views

Urls are the routes for the application in general and views are functions (or classes) that execute some logic when certain url or route is reached, targeted or visited, then returning a response.

[URL dipatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/)
[Base views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/class-based-views/base/)

### When creating a view

- Accept a request
- Return a response

#### View argument types

- HttpRequest: This is the most common type of argument for a Django view function. It represents the HTTP request made by the client and includes information such as headers, body, method (GET, POST, etc.), and user session data.

- URL Parameters: Views can receive URL parameters captured from the URL pattern using named groups or regular expressions. These parameters are typically used to pass dynamic data to the view, such as an item ID in a product detail page (/products/<int:item_id>/).

- GET Parameters: Views can access GET parameters sent in the URL query string. For example, in the URL /search/?q=query, the view can receive the q parameter with the value query.

- POST Data: Views handling POST requests can receive data submitted by the client in the request body. This data is often sent through HTML forms and can include fields like text inputs, checkboxes, and file uploads.

- Named Arguments (kwargs): Views can also receive named arguments (\*\*kwargs) in addition to the request object. This is useful for passing additional context or configuration to the view function.

#### Response types

- HttpResponse: Basic HTTP response that can include HTML content.
- JsonResponse: Response containing JSON data.
- HttpResponseRedirect: Redirects the client to a different URL.
- HttpResponseNotFound: Returns a 404 Not Found response.
- HttpResponseServerError: Returns a 500 Internal Server Error response.
- StreamingHttpResponse: Response for streaming large amounts of data.
- FileResponse: Response for serving files (e.g., PDF, images).

### When setting url dispatchers

- should be in a list of paths, generated by path() function each
- apps are not created with urls.py, make sure to create it
- include this app url dispatchers in the main url module

### Path converters

In Django, path converters are special components used in URL patterns to capture and convert parts of a URL into Python data types. They are used within URL patterns defined in Django's URL dispatcher to extract dynamic segments from URLs and pass them as arguments to view functions. Path converters are denoted by angled brackets < > in URL patterns and come in various types, each serving a specific purpose. Here are some common path converters in Django:

- int: Converts the matched string to an integer. For example, <int:pk> captures an integer and passes it as an argument to the view function.

- str: Captures any string without a slash. For example, <str:username> captures a username from the URL.

- slug: Similar to str but ensures the captured string is valid for a URL segment. It's often used for URLs containing human-readable text. For example, <slug:slug_text> captures a slug text from the URL.

- uuid: Captures a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) from the URL. For example, <uuid:uuid_value> captures a UUID from the URL.

- path: Captures the remainder of the URL as a string, including slashes. It's useful for capturing multiple path segments. For example, <path:file_path> captures a file path from the URL.

- Custom converters: Django also allows developers to define custom path converters for handling specialized data types or custom conversion logic.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/<int:year>/', views.year_archive),
    path('blog/<int:year>/<str:month>/', views.month_archive),
    path('blog/<int:year>/<str:month>/<slug:slug>/', views.post_detail),
]

```

### Name arg and reverse

In the context of Django's URL routing system, "reverse" refers to the process of generating a URL based on a named URL pattern and its corresponding view function. This is particularly useful when you want to create URLs dynamically in your code or templates without hardcoding them.
